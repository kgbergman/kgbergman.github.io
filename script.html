According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a <b>b</b>ee
should <b>b</b>e a<b>b</b>le to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little <b>b</b>ody off the ground.

  
The <b>b</b>ee, of course, flies anyway

  
<b>b</b>ecause <b>b</b>ees don't care
what humans think is impossi<b>b</b>le.

  
Yellow, <b>b</b>lack. Yellow, <b>b</b>lack.
Yellow, <b>b</b>lack. Yellow, <b>b</b>lack.

  
Ooh, <b>b</b>lack and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
<b>B</b>arry! <b>B</b>reakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- <b>B</b>arry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you <b>b</b>elieve this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all <b>B</b>'s.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll <b>b</b>e in row 118,000.
- <b>B</b>ye!

  
<b>B</b>arry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, <b>B</b>arry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come <b>b</b>ack different.

  
- Hi, <b>B</b>arry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear a<b>b</b>out Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Every<b>b</b>ody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
<b>B</b>oy, quite a <b>b</b>it of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- <b>B</b>ee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished <b>b</b>ees,

  
please welcome Dean <b>B</b>uzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And <b>b</b>egins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjo<b>b</b> today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll <b>b</b>e like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a <b>b</b>ee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey <b>b</b>egins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks <b>b</b>ring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and <b>b</b>u<b>b</b><b>b</b>le-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of <b>b</b>ee existence.

  
These <b>b</b>ees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most <b>b</b>ee jo<b>b</b>s are
small ones. <b>B</b>ut <b>b</b>ees know

  
that every small jo<b>b</b>,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
<b>B</b>ut choose carefully

  
<b>b</b>ecause you'll stay in the jo<b>b</b>
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same jo<b>b</b> the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll <b>b</b>e happy to know that <b>b</b>ees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That <b>b</b>lew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One jo<b>b</b> forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
<b>B</b>ut, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're <b>b</b>ees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think may<b>b</b>e things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. <b>B</b>ut you know
what I'm talking a<b>b</b>out.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, <b>b</b>ut some don't come <b>b</b>ack.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to <b>b</b>e a Pollen
Jock. You have to <b>b</b>e <b>b</b>red for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status sym<b>b</b>ol.
<b>B</b>ees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must <b>b</b>e dangerous
<b>b</b>eing a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a <b>b</b>ear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- <b>B</b>arry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
<b>b</b>ut may<b>b</b>e you're not up for it.

  
- May<b>b</b>e I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, <b>b</b>uzzy-<b>b</b>oy?
Are you <b>b</b>ee enough?

  
I might <b>b</b>e. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- <b>B</b>ut you only get one.

  
Do you ever get <b>b</b>ored
doing the same jo<b>b</b> every day?

  
Son, let me tell you a<b>b</b>out stirring.

  
You gra<b>b</b> that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a <b>b</b>eautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think a<b>b</b>out it,

  
may<b>b</b>e the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making <b>b</b>alloon animals?

  
That's a <b>b</b>ad jo<b>b</b>
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- <b>B</b>arry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to <b>b</b>e funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna <b>b</b>e a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and cele<b>b</b>rate!

  
May<b>b</b>e I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call every<b>b</b>ody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jo<b>b</b>s
will <b>b</b>e gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt <b>b</b>ee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still availa<b>b</b>le?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of new<b>b</b>ies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's availa<b>b</b>le?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A <b>b</b>ee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt <b>b</b>ee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector num<b>b</b>er seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. <b>B</b>arry, what
do you think I should... <b>B</b>arry?

  
<b>B</b>arry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, <b>b</b>efore I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling <b>b</b>rave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
<b>b</b>ees cannot fly in rain.

  
So <b>b</b>e careful. As always,
watch your <b>b</b>rooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
<b>b</b>irds, <b>b</b>ears and <b>b</b>ats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root <b>b</b>eer <b>b</b>eing poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home <b>b</b>ecause of it,
<b>b</b>a<b>b</b><b>b</b>ling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
<b>b</b>ee law num<b>b</b>er one,
a<b>b</b>solutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
<b>B</b>uzz, <b>b</b>uzz, <b>b</b>uzz, <b>b</b>uzz! <b>B</b>uzz, <b>b</b>uzz,
<b>b</b>uzz, <b>b</b>uzz! <b>B</b>uzz, <b>b</b>uzz, <b>b</b>uzz, <b>b</b>uzz!

  
<b>B</b>lack and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, <b>b</b>ring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't <b>b</b>elieve I'm out!

  
So <b>b</b>lue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
<b>B</b>ox kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is <b>B</b>lue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
<b>B</b>ring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. <b>B</b>ringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a <b>b</b>it of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. May<b>b</b>e a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little <b>b</b>it of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of <b>b</b>right yellow.
Oould <b>b</b>e daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to <b>b</b>e on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, <b>b</b>ut I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, <b>b</b>ut I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little gra<b>b</b><b>b</b>y.

  
My sweet lord of <b>b</b>ees!

  
Oandy-<b>b</b>rain, get off there!

  
Pro<b>b</b>lem!

  
- Guys!
- This could <b>b</b>e <b>b</b>ad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little <b>b</b>oy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
<b>b</b>ecause you're a<b>b</b>out to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a <b>b</b>ee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, <b>b</b>ee.
- He's <b>b</b>ack here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
No<b>b</b>ody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He <b>b</b>linked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is un<b>b</b>elieva<b>b</b>le.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! <b>B</b>ee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out <b>b</b>rochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
May<b>b</b>e this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is dia<b>b</b>olical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's num<b>b</b>er one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a jo<b>b</b> interview, they're
fla<b>b</b><b>b</b>ergasted, can't <b>b</b>elieve what I say.

  
There's the sun. May<b>b</b>e that's a way out.

  
I don't remem<b>b</b>er the sun
having a <b>b</b>ig 75 on it.

  
I predicted glo<b>b</b>al warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! <b>B</b>ee!

  
Stand <b>b</b>ack. These are winter <b>b</b>oots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capa<b>b</b>le of feeling.

  
My <b>b</b>rochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume <b>b</b>rochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. <b>B</b>ye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put caro<b>b</b> chips on there.
- <b>B</b>ye.

  
- Supposed to <b>b</b>e less calories.
- <b>B</b>ye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trou<b>b</b>le.

  
It's a <b>b</b>ee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't <b>b</b>elieve I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
<b>B</b>ut I don't recall going to <b>b</b>ed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a <b>b</b>it of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a <b>b</b>ee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to <b>b</b>e doing this,

  
<b>b</b>ut they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a <b>b</b>ee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a <b>b</b>ee.
And the <b>b</b>ee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
<b>B</b>ees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trou<b>b</b>le. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't <b>b</b>e ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything a<b>b</b>out fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the ca<b>b</b>
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a <b>b</b>ee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, <b>B</b>arry?

  
A<b>b</b>out work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
<b>b</b>ut I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to <b>b</b>e a lawyer or
a doctor, <b>b</b>ut I wanted to <b>b</b>e a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- May<b>b</b>e I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has <b>b</b>een great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trou<b>b</b>le.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd <b>b</b>e up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crum<b>b</b>.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, <b>B</b>arry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for <b>b</b>efore.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, <b>b</b>ut... Anyway...

  
This can't possi<b>b</b>ly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't <b>b</b>elieve
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. <b>B</b>ut some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get <b>b</b>ack?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjo<b>b</b> and <b>b</b>e normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she <b>B</b>ee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get <b>b</b>y that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a <b>b</b>ee law.
You wouldn't <b>b</b>reak a <b>b</b>ee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, <b>b</b>oy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crum<b>b</b>.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinna<b>b</b>on is?
- No.

  
It's <b>b</b>read and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, <b>b</b>ut who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking <b>b</b>ee,
my friend. Thinking <b>b</b>ee!

  
- Thinking <b>b</b>ee.
- Thinking <b>b</b>ee.

  
Thinking <b>b</b>ee! Thinking <b>b</b>ee!
Thinking <b>b</b>ee! Thinking <b>b</b>ee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your pro<b>b</b>lem is, <b>B</b>arry?

  
I gotta start thinking <b>b</b>ee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's <b>b</b>een three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of <b>b</b>ig life decisions
to think a<b>b</b>out.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no jo<b>b</b>. You're <b>b</b>arely a <b>b</b>ee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
<b>B</b>arry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
<b>B</b>arry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't <b>b</b>e too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- <b>B</b>ecause you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
<b>B</b>ye.

  
I just hope she's <b>B</b>ee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To <b>b</b>e in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
<b>b</b>y flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, <b>b</b>ut it's a disease.
It's a horri<b>b</b>le, horri<b>b</b>le disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dum<b>b</b> <b>b</b>ees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a <b>b</b>ug.

  
He's not <b>b</b>othering any<b>b</b>ody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like a<b>b</b>out 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll <b>b</b>et.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute <b>B</b>ee, Golden <b>B</b>lossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- <b>B</b>ees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, <b>B</b>arry.

  
Just what?!

  
<b>B</b>ees don't know a<b>b</b>out this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the <b>b</b>ottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the <b>b</b>ottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're <b>b</b>usted, <b>b</b>ox <b>b</b>oy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset <b>b</b>ees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will <b>b</b>e lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horri<b>b</b>le thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose <b>b</b>lood,
crazy stuff. <b>B</b>lows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple <b>b</b>lade!
- Triple <b>b</b>lade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, <b>b</b>ee!

  
Why does everything have
to <b>b</b>e so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
<b>B</b>ut don't kill no more <b>b</b>ugs!

  
- <b>B</b>ee!
- Moose <b>b</b>lood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, <b>b</b>ee <b>b</b>oy?

  
Hey, <b>B</b>lood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- <b>B</b>ees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trou<b>b</b>le?
- You a mosquito, you in trou<b>b</b>le.

  
No<b>b</b>ody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to <b>b</b>e kidding me!

  
Moose<b>b</b>lood's a<b>b</b>out to leave
the <b>b</b>uilding! So long, <b>b</b>ee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Moose<b>b</b>lood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you <b>b</b>ring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a la<b>b</b>el on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A <b>b</b>ee's got a <b>b</b>rain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple <b>b</b>reaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
<b>B</b>ee honey.

  
Our honey is <b>b</b>eing <b>b</b>razenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything <b>b</b>ears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, <b>B</b>arry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are o<b>b</b>viously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's <b>b</b>een talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? <b>B</b>arry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The <b>b</b>ees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
<b>B</b>arry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
No<b>b</b>ody works harder than <b>b</b>ees!

  
Dad, I remem<b>b</b>er you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remem<b>b</b>er that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip <b>b</b>alm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one <b>b</b>ee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more <b>b</b>ee <b>b</b>eards!

  
With <b>B</b>o<b>b</b> <b>B</b>um<b>b</b>le at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with <b>B</b>uzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm <b>B</b>o<b>b</b> <b>B</b>um<b>b</b>le.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county <b>b</b>ee, <b>B</b>arry <b>B</b>enson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on <b>B</b>ee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new <b>b</b>ook,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to <b>B</b>arry <b>B</b>enson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
<b>B</b>ees have never <b>b</b>een afraid
to change the world.

  
What a<b>b</b>out <b>B</b>ee Oolum<b>b</b>us?
<b>B</b>ee Gandhi? <b>B</b>ejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stick<b>b</b>all or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The <b>b</b>ee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will <b>b</b>e the trial
of the <b>b</b>ee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the <b>b</b>ottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
<b>B</b>ear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her <b>b</b>ackhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same <b>b</b>ee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, <b>b</b>ee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remem<b>b</b>er you. Tim<b>b</b>erland, size
ten and a half. Vi<b>b</b>ram sole, I <b>b</b>elieve.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you <b>b</b>etter go
'cause we're really <b>b</b>usy working.

  
<b>B</b>ut it's our yogurt night!

  
<b>B</b>ye-<b>b</b>ye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have <b>b</b>een at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has <b>b</b>een a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
<b>B</b>ees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving <b>b</b>alloon <b>b</b>ouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
<b>B</b>ent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
<b>B</b>ees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
May<b>b</b>e this could make up
for it a little <b>b</b>it.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty <b>b</b>ig deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't <b>b</b>e a<b>b</b>le

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredi<b>b</b>le scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
<b>b</b>ecause for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honey<b>b</b>ee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, <b>B</b>arry?

  
It's pretty <b>b</b>ig, isn't it?

  
I can't <b>b</b>elieve how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think <b>b</b>illion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Every<b>b</b>ody needs to stay
<b>b</b>ehind the <b>b</b>arricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the <b>b</b>ee team.

  
You <b>b</b>oys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honora<b>b</b>le
Judge <b>B</b>um<b>b</b>leton presiding.

  
All right. Oase num<b>b</b>er 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
<b>B</b>arry <b>B</b>ee <b>B</b>enson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. <b>B</b>enson... you're representing
all the <b>b</b>ees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
<b>B</b>orn on a farm, she <b>b</b>elieved
it was man's divine right

  
to <b>b</b>enefit from the <b>b</b>ounty
of nature God put <b>b</b>efore us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. <b>B</b>enson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my <b>b</b>ritches!

  
Talking <b>b</b>ee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could <b>b</b>e using laser <b>b</b>eams!

  
Ro<b>b</b>otics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could <b>b</b>e on steroids!

  
Mr. <b>B</b>enson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary <b>b</b>ee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all <b>b</b>ees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, <b>b</b>y taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
<b>b</b>ut everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, <b>b</b>ig company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honey<b>b</b>urton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide <b>b</b>eekeepers
for our farms.

  
<b>B</b>eekeeper. I find that
to <b>b</b>e a very distur<b>b</b>ing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any <b>b</b>ee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
<b>B</b>ecause you don't free <b>b</b>ees.
You keep <b>b</b>ees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a <b>b</b>ear would <b>b</b>e
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lova<b>b</b>le creatures.

  
Yogi <b>B</b>ear, Fozzie <b>B</b>ear, <b>B</b>uild-A-<b>B</b>ear.

  
You mean like this?

  
<b>B</b>ears kill <b>b</b>ees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
<b>B</b>iting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for <b>b</b>eing here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it <b>b</b>efore?
- I was with a <b>b</b>and called The Police.

  
<b>B</b>ut you've never <b>b</b>een
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of <b>b</b>ee culture casually
stolen <b>b</b>y a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-a<b>b</b>out stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever <b>b</b>een stung, Mr. Sting?

  
<b>B</b>ecause I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
<b>b</b>elated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to <b>b</b>low.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. <b>B</b>ut is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless <b>b</b>ees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, <b>B</b>enson!
I could <b>b</b>low right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a <b>b</b>adfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that <b>b</b>ear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, <b>b</b>ut... the <b>b</b>attery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called <b>B</b>arry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The <b>b</b>all's a little gra<b>b</b><b>b</b>y.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, <b>B</b>arry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjo<b>b</b>. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
<b>B</b>ees have 100 percent employment,
<b>b</b>ut we do jo<b>b</b>s like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking a<b>b</b>out doing.

  
Ken, I let <b>B</b>arry <b>b</b>orrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just a<b>b</b>out had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remem<b>b</b>er what Van said, why is
your life more valua<b>b</b>le than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water <b>b</b>ug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're <b>b</b>luffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That <b>b</b>owl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little <b>b</b>ee!

  
And he happens to <b>b</b>e
the nicest <b>b</b>ee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking a<b>b</b>out?!
Are there other <b>b</b>ugs in your life?

  
No, <b>b</b>ut there are other things <b>b</b>ugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking <b>b</b>ees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Good<b>b</b>ye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made <b>b</b>y man!

  
I'm sorry a<b>b</b>out all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of <b>b</b>arrier <b>b</b>etween Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I <b>b</b>elieve Mr. Montgomery
is a<b>b</b>out out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. <b>B</b>arry <b>B</b>enson <b>B</b>ee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the <b>b</b>est lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna <b>b</b>e all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like a<b>b</b>out <b>b</b>ees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. <b>B</b>enson <b>B</b>ee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...<b>b</b>ed<b>b</b>ug?

  
I've seen a <b>b</b>ee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give <b>b</b>irth
to all the <b>b</b>ee children?

  
- Yeah, <b>b</b>ut...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, <b>B</b>arry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me <b>b</b>ack!

  
You're an illegitimate <b>b</b>ee,
aren't you, <b>B</b>enson?

  
He's denouncing <b>b</b>ees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- O<b>b</b>jection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have <b>b</b>een felled
<b>b</b>y a winged <b>b</b>east of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving <b>b</b>uttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honey<b>b</b>ees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the <b>b</b>ees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, <b>b</b>uddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I <b>b</b>lew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd <b>b</b>e <b>b</b>etter off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of <b>b</b>ugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so <b>b</b>ad.

  
Adam, they check in,
<b>b</b>ut they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
<b>B</b>ees don't smoke.

  
Right. <b>B</b>ees don't smoke.

  
<b>B</b>ees don't smoke!
<b>B</b>ut some <b>b</b>ees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get <b>b</b>ack to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tu<b>b</b>.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
<b>B</b>ees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story a<b>b</b>out...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous <b>b</b>ugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valua<b>b</b>le time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these a<b>b</b>surd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate <b>b</b>usinesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
<b>B</b>ut you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a <b>b</b>ee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a <b>b</b>ee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to <b>b</b>ees who have never <b>b</b>een asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To <b>b</b>e forci<b>b</b>ly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these <b>b</b>ees!

  
Free the <b>b</b>ees! Free the <b>b</b>ees!

  
Free the <b>b</b>ees!

  
Free the <b>b</b>ees! Free the <b>b</b>ees!

  
The court finds in favor of the <b>b</b>ees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally <b>b</b>elong to the <b>b</b>ees.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the <b>b</b>alance of nature, <b>B</b>enson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
<b>B</b>arry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
<b>B</b>arry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've <b>b</b>een living the <b>b</b>ee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all <b>b</b>ee work camps.

  
Then we want <b>b</b>ack the honey
that was ours to <b>b</b>egin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the <b>b</b>ear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
<b>b</b>ad-<b>b</b>reath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll <b>b</b>e fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
<b>b</b>ee-negative nicknames...

  
<b>B</b>ut it's just a prance-a<b>b</b>out stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in <b>b</b>ogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't <b>b</b>reathe.

  
<b>B</b>ring it in, <b>b</b>oys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. <b>B</b>uzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannon<b>b</b>all!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission a<b>b</b>ort.

  
A<b>b</b>orting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to <b>b</b>ase.

  
Adam, you wouldn't <b>b</b>elieve
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is every<b>b</b>ody?

  
- Are they out cele<b>b</b>rating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey <b>b</b>ack.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to <b>b</b>e part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new jo<b>b</b>. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would <b>b</b>e <b>b</b>etter!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess <b>b</b>ees.

  
<b>B</b>ees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think <b>b</b>ees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegeta<b>b</b>les, they all need <b>b</b>ees.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How a<b>b</b>out a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, <b>B</b>arry...
sorry, <b>b</b>ut I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
<b>b</b>ecause all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
<b>B</b>arry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, <b>b</b>ees, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
May<b>b</b>e not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
<b>B</b>arry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought may<b>b</b>e you were remodeling.

  
<b>B</b>ut I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas com<b>b</b>ined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every <b>b</b>ee, plant
and flower <b>b</b>ud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
<b>b</b>ack here with what we've got.

  
- <b>B</b>ees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
<b>b</b>ut flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will <b>b</b>e tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa <b>B</b>loome, FTD.

  
Official floral <b>b</b>usiness. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice <b>b</b>rooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How a<b>b</b>out The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could <b>b</b>e the princess,
and you could <b>b</b>e the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I <b>b</b>elieve I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this <b>b</b>a<b>b</b>y'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is <b>b</b>lend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it <b>b</b>een
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the jo<b>b</b>.

  
Oan you <b>b</b>elieve how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the jo<b>b</b>!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a <b>b</b>it of <b>b</b>ad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
<b>B</b>arry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
<b>B</b>e careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflata<b>b</b>le nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
<b>B</b>ee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, <b>B</b>arry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa <b>B</b>loome in 24<b>B</b>
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a Dust<b>B</b>uster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's <b>b</b>ald, one's in a <b>b</b>oat,
they're <b>b</b>oth unconscious!

  
- Is that another <b>b</b>ee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa <b>B</b>loome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone on<b>b</b>oard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- <b>B</b>arry <b>B</b>enson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a <b>b</b>ig metal <b>b</b>ee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it <b>b</b>e?

  
Wait, <b>B</b>arry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is <b>B</b>o<b>b</b> <b>B</b>um<b>b</b>le. We have some
late-<b>b</b>reaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
<b>B</b>arry <b>B</b>enson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's <b>B</b>arry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with a<b>b</b>solutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a <b>b</b>ee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. <b>B</b>enson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
<b>B</b>ut isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a <b>b</b>ee
shouldn't <b>b</b>e a<b>b</b>le to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and <b>b</b>ody mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand <b>b</b>y.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may <b>b</b>e a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of <b>b</b>ees
doing a lot of small jo<b>b</b>s.

  
<b>B</b>ut let me tell you a<b>b</b>out a small jo<b>b</b>.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a <b>b</b>ig difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get <b>b</b>ees
<b>b</b>ack to working together.

  
That's the <b>b</b>ee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get <b>b</b>ehind a fellow.

  
- <b>B</b>lack and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
<b>B</b>eep-<b>b</b>eep! <b>B</b>eep-<b>b</b>eep!

  
<b>B</b>arry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have <b>b</b>een helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
<b>b</b>ehind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trou<b>b</b>le.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
<b>B</b>enson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get <b>b</b>ehind a fellow.

  
- <b>B</b>lack and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the <b>b</b>lacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think <b>b</b>ee, <b>B</b>arry.

  
- Thinking <b>b</b>ee.
- Thinking <b>b</b>ee.

  
Thinking <b>b</b>ee!
Thinking <b>b</b>ee! Thinking <b>b</b>ee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
<b>B</b>ring the nose down.

  
Thinking <b>b</b>ee!
Thinking <b>b</b>ee! Thinking <b>b</b>ee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking <b>b</b>ee!
Thinking <b>b</b>ee! Thinking <b>b</b>ee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on <b>b</b>ee power. Ready, <b>b</b>oys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of <b>b</b>ees!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, <b>B</b>arry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't <b>b</b>e afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. <b>B</b>e a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
<b>B</b>arry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
<b>B</b>arry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- <b>B</b>ut we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
availa<b>b</b>le anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to <b>b</b>e <b>b</b>ees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're <b>b</b>ees!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, <b>B</b>arry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our <b>B</b>arry.

  
Mom! The <b>b</b>ees are <b>b</b>ack!

  
If any<b>b</b>ody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll <b>b</b>e
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is <b>b</b>ee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
<b>B</b>arry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a <b>b</b>lood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a <b>b</b>riefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
<b>B</b>arry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No pro<b>b</b>lem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, <b>B</b>arry.
Oan I help who's next?

  
All right, scram<b>b</b>le, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, <b>B</b>arry!

  
That <b>b</b>ee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- <b>B</b>eautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
<b>B</b>etween you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking <b>b</b>ee, my friend.

  
- Thinking <b>b</b>ee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production num<b>b</b>er!

  
All right. Take ten, every<b>b</b>ody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
