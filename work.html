    <h2><br><br>My Work with the Hive</h2>
    <main>
        <p>Here is a video of my colleague <b>B</b>eeter and I collecting nectar. We work diligently for our hive day in and day out. We collect nectar for food for the colony. While we do this, we pollinate plants. We store this nectar in our stomachs until the water within it diminishes. Once this happens, the nectar <b>b</b>ecomes honey!</p>

    <h2><br><br>My Work in the Law</h2>
    	<p>As you may already know, I am an advocate for <b>B</b>ee Rights. There is a lot of issues with the way <b>b</b>ees are treated in these so called "farms". I am fighting to get <b>b</b>ees the rights they deserve. These rights include worker's compensation, equal wages, and most importantly, the use of humane smokers. I've included a short video highlighting the points of why these prisons are inhumane and what a real <b>b</b>ee looks like.</p>

        <p style="color: gray; font-style: italic">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a <b>b</b>ee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little <b>b</b>ody off the ground. The <b>b</b>ee, of course, flies anyways. <b>B</b>ecause <b>b</b>ees don't care what humans think is impossi<b>b</b>le.</p>
