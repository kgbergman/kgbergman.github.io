    <h2><br><br>My Work with the Hive</h2>
    <main>
        <p>Here is a video of my colleague Beeter and I collecting nectar. We work diligently for our hive day in and day out. We collect nectar for food for the colony. While we do this, we pollinate plants. We store this nectar in our stomachs until the water within it diminishes. Once this happens, the nectar becomes honey!</p>

    <h2><br><br>My Work in the Law</h2>
    	<p>As you may already know, I am an advocate for Bee Rights. There is a lot of issues with the way bees are treated in these so called "farms". I am fighting to get bees the rights they deserve. These rights include worker's compensation, equal wages, and most importantly, the use of humane smokers. I've included a short video highlighting the points of why these prisons are inhumane and what a real bee looks like.</p>

        <p style="color: gray; font-style: italic">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</p>
