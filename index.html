        <h2>About Beegan</h2>
        <img class="leftprofile" src="images/honeybee.jpg" alt="profile picture">
        <p>I've attended three days of grade school, three days of high school, and three days of college. I took a gap day and hitchhiked around the hive. I'm a worker bee, like any other. I work for Honex, a division of Honesco, part of the Hexagon Group. I've worked my whole life to get to the point where I can work for my whole life. Like any other bee, I know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. </p>
        
        <h2><br><br>What is my purpose?</h2>
        <img class="profile" src="images/honeybee2.jpg" alt="profile picture">
        <p>My purpose is to liberate the bees and sue the human race for stealing our honey. The unequal treatment of bees on farms like Honey Farms is too much for me to handle. Bee smokers are unethical. The exploitation of bees has gone on long enough!</p>
        <p>I've gathered the support of millions of bees and humans alike. Can I count on your support?</p>
        
        <h2><br><br>Honey</h2>
        <img class="leftprofile" src="images/honey.jpg" alt="profile picture">
        <p>Honey. What's not to love about it? It is sweet, gooey, and just simply goes with everything. We bees love our honey. I'm guilty as charged with being a honey addict. I've actually taken a few classes to get over it, but they haven't done much for me. I've learned that it is better to just embrace the delectable honey rather than try to avoid it.</p>
        <p>Bees pollinate flowers. Bees make honey. Bees keep the world going. If it wasn't for bees, a lot of what you love would not be around! A few examples.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>No honey.</li>
            <li>No flowers.</li>
            <li>No honey.</li>
            <li>No honey!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Basically, you need us. You're welcome. If you want bees to keep working for you, then stop imprisoning us. If the unequal treatment of bees continue, we will strike. Bees have more control than you think.</p>

        <p style="color: gray; font-style: italic">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</p>
