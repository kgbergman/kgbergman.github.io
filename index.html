        <h2>About Beegan</h2>
        <img class="leftprofile" src="images/honeybee.jpg" alt="profile picture">
        <p>I've attended three days of grade school, three days of high school, and three days of college. I took a gap day and hitchhiked around the hive. I'm a worker <b>b</b>ee, like any other. I work for Honex, a division of Honesco, part of the Hexagon Group. I've worked my whole life to get to the point where I can work for my whole life. Like any other <b>b</b>ee, I know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. </p>
        
        <h2><br><br>What is my purpose?</h2>
        <img class="profile" src="images/honeybee2.jpg" alt="profile picture">
        <p>My purpose is to li<b>b</b>erate the <b>b</b>ees and sue the human race for stealing our honey. The unequal treatment of <b>b</b>ees on farms like Honey Farms is too much for me to handle. <b>B</b>ee smokers are unethical. The exploitation of <b>b</b>ees has gone on long enough!</p>
        <p>I've gathered the support of millions of <b>b</b>ees and humans alike. Can I count on your support?</p>

        <h2><br>Honey</h2>

        <p>Honey. What's not to love about it? It is sweet, gooey, and just simply goes with everything. We <b>b</b>ees love our honey. I'm guilty as charged with <b>b</b>eing a honey addict. I've actually taken a few classes to get over it, <b>b</b>ut they haven't done much for me. I've learned that it is better to just em<b>b</b>race the delecta<b>b</b>le honey rather than try to avoid it.</p>
        <p><b>B</b>ees pollinate flowers. <b>B</b>ees make honey. <b>B</b>ees keep the world going. If it wasn't for <b>b</b>ees, a lot of what you love would not be around! A few examples.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>No honey.</li>
            <li>No flowers.</li>
            <li>No honey.</li>
            <li>No honey!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>B</b>asically, you need us. You're welcome. If you want <b>b</b>ees to keep working for you, then stop imprisoning us. If the unequal treatment of <b>b</b>ees continue, we will strike. <b>B</b>ees have more control than you think.</p>

Its wings are too small to get its fat little <b>b</b>ody off the ground. The <b>b</b>ee, of course, flies anyways. <b>B</b>ecause <b>b</b>ees don't care what humans think is impossi<b>b</b>le.</p>
