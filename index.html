        <h2>About Barry</h2>
        <img class="leftprofile" src="images/bee.jpg" alt="profile picture">
        <p>I've attended three days of grade school, three days of high school, and three days of college. I took a gap day and hitchhiked around the hive. I'm a worker bee, like any other. I work for Honex, a division of Honesco, part of the Hexagon Group. I've worked my whole life to get to the point where I can work for my whole life. Like any other bee, I know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. I have a girlfriend, Vanessa, who is a human. She works at a flower shop. I met her when I was out on a pollen mission outside the hive. I got caught in the rain and ended up on her balcony. Her boyfriend at the time tried to squish me, but thankfully Vanessa caught me and released me.</p>
        
        <h2>What is my purpose?</h2>
        <img class="profile" src="images/barrybbenson.jpg" alt="profile picture">
        <p>My purpose is to liberate the bees and sue the human race for stealing our honey. The unequal treatment of bees on farms like Honey Farms is too much for me to handle. Bee smokers are unethical. The exploitation of bees has gone on long enough!</p>
        <p>I've gathered the support of millions of bees and humans alike. We are up against Layton T. Montgomery, one of the toughest defense attorneys in the land. So far the trial has gone well, even though Vanessa's (ex)boyfriend Ken has tried to kill me again.</p>

        <p style="color: gray; font-style: italic">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</p>
