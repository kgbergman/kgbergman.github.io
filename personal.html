        <p>I was <b>b</b>orn on in the hive. My father is a worker <b>b</b>ee. He is part of the pollination force. He collects nectar so we can make honey. My mother is a servant to the Queen. She <b>b</b>rings her honey and helps take care of the Queen's children, 1,500 per day! I'm still <b>b</b>est friends with my <b>b</b>uddies from grade school. I played <b>b</b>eesket<b>b</b>all with <b>B</b>eethan up through high school. Merce<b>b</b>ees and I go way <b>b</b>ack, we were in day care together! <b>B</b>eeanna and I are cousins, <b>b</b>ut we went to school together too. We played in the <b>b</b>and together. I played <b>b</b>eeano and she played the <b>b</b>eecorder.</p>
        <h3><br>Relationships</h3>
        <p>I have a girlfriend, her name is <b>B</b>eeatrice. We met at a flower shop on Main Street. It was love at first flight. I'll never forget the way she <b>b</b>um<b>b</b>led when we first met. She was so <b>b</b>lack and so yellow. I commissioned a song to <b>b</b>e written for her <b>b</b>y my friend Wiz Khalifa, you may have heard of it.</p<>

        <h3><br>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I have plenty of ho<b>b</b><b>b</b>ies. Some of my favorites are playing the <b>b</b>eetar, listening to music on my <b>B</b>eets by Dre&copy; headphones, and taking long walks on the <b>b</b>eech. I played <b>b</b>eesket<b>b</b>all in high school. I was going to go to the Olympics until I got my stinger caught in another player trying to <b>b</b>ox them out. I was in the hospital for three whole hours. Here is a link to my favorite documentary, <a href="script.html">The <b>B</b>ee Movie</a>, written by my friend Jerry Seinfeld. It is about the struggles us <b>b</b>ees go through on a daily <b>b</b>asis. </p>

        <p style="color: gray; font-style: italic">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a <b>b</b>ee should <b>b</b>e a<b>b</b>le to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little <b>b</b>ody off the ground. The <b>b</b>ee, of course, flies anyways. <b>B</b>ecause <b>b</b>ees don't care what humans think is impossi<b>b</b>le.</p>
